# Code Description: This code handles some of the condition monitoring as well as some of the GPIO triggers
# to the SMS system to call for the SMS functions. This code handles the heartbeat monitoring of the on-site
# RPI4. the code counts 3 variables, how many times the loop catches a frozen 0 or a frozen 1
# if the heartbeat has toggled by the next cycle this is considered an RTU_OK contition,
# these are also counted.
# if 30 frozen 0's or frozen 1's are reached before 10 RTU_OK's then the heartbeat if considered to be frozen
# at this point the Loss of heartbeat trigger is sent to the arduino.
# if 10 RTU_OK's are reached before the frozen bits hit 30 the counts are reset to 0 as the heartbeat is considered ok
# code then sleeps for an hour before checking heartbeat again.
