# Sligo_IT_Final_Project---- CHLORINE DISINFECTION SYSTEM USING DATA ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING CONTROL

Hi there, this is my final year project for the Sligo Institute of technology.

The code files are seperated into the devices in which the code is running on. The android code files only contain files in which i had written code, this is
due to when exporting android studio projects to github there are a huge amount of file in which 95% of, i had no interaction with. thus the files displayed are 
the only files i have written code for the android app.
