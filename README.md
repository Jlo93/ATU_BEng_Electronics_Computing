# Sligo_IT_Final_Project---- CHLORINE DISINFECTION SYSTEM USING DATA ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING CONTROL

Hi, this is my final year project for the Sligo Institute of technology.

The aim of this project was to build a prototype system to aid in the operation & decision making in the chlorine disinfection process used in water treatment facilities in Ireland, by leveraging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) principles, Data harvesting & Analytics, Cloud technology, Machine learning (ML) to provide suggested control set-point values, an android application to view process conditions & SMS warning system. With the hope of  creating more connected, transperant & efficient processes.

The technical aims of this project was to: 

1: Provide a small, cost effective, minimally invasive device to connect via Ethernet to existing control system infrastructure i.e. Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) 

2: Develop code to harvest real-time process data from the control system & route the data to a cloud database to hold the real-time data.

3: Build & Train a ML model using site specific historical data, that is capablele of producing (outputting) a suggested (predicted) control set-point based on   process variables provided to the model as inputs.

4: Develop an android application with user login/register functionality to pull the data from the real-time database on the cloud & display this to the user. 

5: Provide a small cost effective SMS system that monitors both process & device health status via the cloud & trigger appropriate SMS warnings i.e. process alarms, device loss of heartbeat (LOHB) etc. 


The code files are seperated into the devices in which the code is running on. The android code files only contain files in which i had written code, this is
due to when exporting android studio projects to github there are a huge amount of file in which 95% of, i had no interaction with. thus the files displayed are 
the only files i have written code for the android app.
